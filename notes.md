# HTTP observations (Lab 4, Task 1)

| Question | My answer |
|----------|-----------|
| Request method for index.html | GET |
| Status code with Disable cache ticked | 200 |
| Status code on a normal reload | 304 |
| Status code for /nothing-here.html | 404 |
| Value of the Content-Type response header | text/html |
| Remote Address (IP and port) | 127.0.0.1:5500 |
| Protocol in the address bar (http or https) | http |

## Why is this address http and not https?
This server is running locally on localhost (127.0.0.1), so traffic never leaves the computer. HTTPS encryption is not required for local development environment traffic.
